Sping Annotataion:-  
-------------------

Spring Annotations allows us to configure dependencies and implement dependency injection through java programs.

*Spring framework implements and promotes the principle of control inversion (IOC) or dependency injection (DI) and is in fact an IOC container.

*Traditionally, Spring allows a developer to manage bean dependencies by using XML-based configuration.

*There is an alternative way to define beans and their dependencies. This method is a Java-based configuration.

*Unlike the XML approach, Java-based configuration allows you to manage bean components programmatically. That’s why Spring annotations were introduced.

@PropertySource("classpath:oracledatabase.properties") // load the profiles files.
